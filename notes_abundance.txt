RUNNING THE SCRIPTS (steps):
1) ../12-blast_parse_abundance.py -i Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3.csv
   The infile has sequences that it writes into individual files then creates and runs
  a blast shell script (one blast command per *.fa file) then outputs the blast rusults
  in a specific format (all in the ./work directory)

2) Run the same script but with the --parse tag: 
   ../12-blast_parse_abundance.py --parse
   This parses all the blast out files in ./work and calculates NUM_BEST_HITS BEST_PCT_ID BEST_FULL_PCT_ID
   Output is BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv

Hand-curation by JMW: 
   must now add 'ABUNDANCE_IN' (Changed to 'BODY_SITE' by JMW) column to BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv 
   (use V1-V3-BodySiteList-Curated-218-Firmicutes_fixed.csv as input)
   eren2014_combine_curtated.py -i1
   Hand-curation by JMW: must now add 'Assign_reads_to' and 'Add_Note' columns to BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv
   (use BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration.csv as input)
   eren2014_combine_curtated.py
   See: V1-V3-BodySiteList-Curated-extra.csv
   ***UPDATE:: JMW changed 98.5 to 98% inclusion so use: 
      BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration-v2-2021-12-21-4pm.csv as i1 in step#3
      
After Curation by JMW you get this: 
  BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration-v2-2021-12-21-4pm.csv
headers:
  OLIGOTYPE,BODY_SITE,PHYLUM,NUM_BEST_HITS,BEST_PCT_ID,BEST_FULL_PCT_ID,Assign_reads_to,Add_Note,HMTs,HOMD_SPECIES,STRAIN_CLONE,HOMD_REFSEQ_ID,GB_NCBI_ID,HOMD_STATUS      
3) Add the oral subject-site counts to the file from data found here S01(v1v3):
   https://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/E2875/tab-figures-data
   ../3-abundance_add_counts_per_site.py -i1 BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration.csv -i2 pnas_counts_per_oligo.csv
   ** Dehirst -- SKIP THIS STEP
   
4) Next run: for endpoint1
   ../4-abundance_calculate_pcts.py -i NEW-BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration_wcounts.csv
   to convert counts to percents (summing each subject-site across all oligotypes)
   Endpoint1: filename w/ pcts:  HOMD-ENDPOINT1_wpcts.csv
   testing: cut -f1,7 HOMD-endpoint1-wpcts.csv
   
   ** Dewhirst -- Add nasal counts as input here
   ../4-abundance_calculate_pcts.py -i NEW-BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration_wcounts.csv -i2 Nasal_counts.csv -s dewhirst_35x9
   
4a) cp NEW-BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration_wpcts.csv ==> HOMD-ENDPOINT1_wpcts.csv

5) Creates a table of all HMTS in HOMD with 770 columns of subject-sites
   Then fill in those abundance cells with the data from the 'endpoint1' infile:
   Create 'gut' and 'noclosematch'; split off HMTs; add abund*multiplier in 'Assign_reads_to'
   ../5-abundance_coalesce.py -i HOMD-endpoint1-wpcts.csv
   
#6) ****NOT USED =Convert samplesites to MEAN,SD,PREV
#   ../6-abundance_calc_means.py -i HOMD_NEWcoalesce01.csv   
#   output: HOMD_NEW_MeanStdevPrev_2021-12-22.csv  NOT USED!

START HERE AFTER HMT NAME CHANGES
7) use HOMD_NEWcoalesce01_2021-12-22.csv  to change HMTs to taxonomy 
   ../7-abundance_hmt2taxonomy.py -i HOMD_NEWcoalesce01_2021-12-22.csv (HMTs,notes, sample-sites)
   output:   HOMD_NEW_taxonomyNcounts_2021-12-22.csv
   

8)  Split up the taxonomy and create a python matrix to summ the abundance numbers 
   ../8-gather_abundance_by_rank.py -i HOMD_NEW_taxonomyNpcts_2021-12-22.csv
   output: {source}_rank_abundance_sums_{date}_homd.csv
   
   
9) ../9-abundance_ranks_calc_means.py -i {source}_rank_abundance_sums_{date}_homd.csv
   Output is FINAL  -- which is input to Initialize_Abundance.py
   ie eren2014_v1v3_MeanStdevPrev_byRankFINAL_2021-12-24_homd.csv
   
LOAD-LOAD-LOAD            
10) Load abundance to db ../10-load_abundance2db.py 
    -i eren2014_v1v3_MeanStdevPrev_byRankFINAL_2021-12-26_homd.csv
    -i segata_edit2021-12-24.csv -s segata
    -i dewhirst_edit2021-12-27.csv -s dewhirst_35x9
    
10a) Re-Create json file
    ./Initialize_Taxonomy.py

Here is the Excel file I'm working from, in case that is of interest...
Floyd35x9_CountsMatrix-JMWcuration.csv
35x9_FromFloyd_Dec2021.xlsx
The site names are a little different from what we're used to;
BUC is buccal mucosa,
KGN is keratinized gingiva;
PAL is hard palate (not palatine tonsils)
SUB is sub-gingival plaque;
SUP is supra-gingival plaque;
TNG is tongue dorsum;
THR is throat;
TON is palatine tonsils;
SAL is saliva.
The fourth tab on this spreadsheet gives you some more information about the samples, but here is a summary in email form:

The columns represent 35 buccal mucosa samples; 43 keratinized gingiva; 38 hard palate; 74 subgingival and 36 supragingival plaque; 42 tongue;
 33 throat; 31 tongue; 50 saliva.  With 35 donors, that means there are multiple samples from some individuals (and some samples missing.)  
 We could pick a single sample from each subject, but I think it's OK to just use all the samples and report mean, standard deviation, and 
 prevalence across all the samples.  

***For prevalence, perhaps it would be a good idea also to report prevalence by individual: after converting the counts matrix to percents, 
if there are multiple samples from a single person-site, we collapse them into one by taking the average of the samples.  
Then proceed with this slimmed-down matrix.  We could do it both ways and see how much difference it makes.

we have just created: HOMD_NEW_MeanStdevPrev_2021-12-22.csv
We have arrived at the last step!   
Propagating the mean, stdev, prevalence up through the taxonomic levels.

You have a matrix of HOMD HMTs x 770 samples, with % abundance of each HMT in each of the 
770 samples.

I envision that you go through the higher-level taxa and add up all the % abundance 
numbers for all the HMTs in each higher-level taxon, giving you a matrix of 
higher taxa x 770 samples.  Then you can calculate mean, standard deviation, prevalence 
for each of these higher taxa, for each of the 10 body sites over 77 samples.

Does that make sense?

(Truth in advertising: the REAL last steps will be to put the data up on the 
HOMD site in bar chart form, and also repeat this analysis for the V3-V5 data and 
Floyd's 35x9 data ðŸ™‚)

2021-12-21
Looks great!

Two tiny things:
-your list of taxa includes "dropped" taxa (HMT-009, HMT-015, HMT-016 etc.) and I 
think it shouldn't.
-V. dispar HMT-160 has two different "notes" and only one of them is showing.  I 
think we should concatenate the notes rather than picking one.

And one slightly bigger thing: while checking these numbers against previous data I 
realized I made an error in requiring 98.5% identity to consider an oligotype identified 
to the HMT (species) level.  Previously I used a 98% threshold instead.  
So I'm attaching a revised curation file with the 98% threshold. 
=> BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration-v2-2021-12-21-4pm.csv
Can you re-run the numbers with this revised curation?

2021-12-20
On the HOMD taxon abundance, for operational next steps, I'm thinking:

-create a table with rows for all HOMD taxa plus "gut taxa" and "no 98.5% match in HOMD"; 
for each of these, there is a column for percent abundance in each individual x body site 
   --> 770 columns of data.  Also there should be a column for "Taxon Abundance Notes"

-going line by line through the oligotype table you created,
if "Assign_reads_to" says "gut", add those % abundances to "gut taxa",
if "Assign_reads_to" says "no_close_match_in_HOMD", add those % abundances to 
    "no 98.5% match in HOMD";
if "Assign_reads_to" says "100", add those % abundances to the relevant HOMD taxon 
    in the new table;
if there are multiple relevant HOMD taxa, multiply the percentage in "Assign_reads_to" 
    by the % abundance and add that to the taxon in the new table.

Also, if there is a value in "Add_Note", append that value to "Taxon Abundance Notes".

2021-12-19
We have worked out how to update the Eren et al. 2014 tables to new HOMD taxonomy.  Yay!

Let's save this file as a useful endpoint relating oligotypes to HOMD taxa:
   ***NEW-BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration_wpcts.csv => HOMD-endpoint1-wpcts.csv
   
Then, for using this data to assign abundances to HOMD taxa at each oral site, the next steps are:

-combine the "gut" oligotypes into a single thing called "99 gut oligotypes" (which will have an 
 abundance in each site in each individual) => col7
-combine the "no_close_match_in_HOMD" oligotypes into a single thing called "no 98.5% match in HOMD" 
 (which will also have an abundance in each site in each individual) => col7
-assign the remaining oligotypes to HOMD taxa, to calculate their abundance in each site 
  in each individual.

*** Percent is calculated by getting the sum of all oligotype counts in a particular sample 
    (e.g. 147406386-TD is a sample from the tongue dorsum of person 147406386), 
    then dividing the counts of each oligotype by the total counts in that sample.
    but no, we want to total each subject count across all oligotypes, separately for each of the oral sites.  
    We're just converting counts to percents within each separate sample.
*** Prevalence = 
   (# of individuals in which this HMT is non-zero at this site)/(total number of individuals for whom we have samples at this site)
   
qend-qstart+1 /qlength == fract align
FULL == PCTID*fract_align  should be == or less than PCTID

from email:
=======================================
There are a few oligotypes with anomalous results -- like V1V3_109_Actinobacteria has best-percent-ID 99.123% and full-percent-ID 100%.  What's going on there?  Full percent ID should always be less than or equal to best percent ID I think.
We can discuss -- I'm free all day.
Once that's figured out -- Great!  You have successfully assigned taxonomy to each oligotype!  Step 1 is complete.

Then we will need to do step 2: 
-add to this table the column showing "ABUNDANT_IN" in the attached "Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3".  We will use "ABUNDANT_IN" to figure out which samples are from stool.
***NOTE :: Use file V1-V3-BodySiteList-Curated-218-Firmicutes.csv instead***

Then: add the counts for each oligotype in each sample, from Dataset S01 here 
https://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/E2875/tab-figures-data
This will create a counts matrix (observation matrix) with these taxonomy labels attached.

Eliminate columns with fewer than (arbitrarily chosen) 800 total reads (I count 12 such columns)
***NOTE:: make it 1000 total reads per JMW

Then convert counts to percents so we have a matrix of percent abundance of each oligotype in each sample.  Save this, for future reference, as the percent matrix.

Then the last step:  group the oligotypes into species:
take the 99 oligotypes for which ABUNDANT_IN = ST and which are not Dialister invisus V1V3_218_Firmicutes (special pleading, ugh, but it's because Dialister invisus is a 100% match to an oral taxon.)
Group these 99 into "99 gut oligotypes".

For the remaining oligotypes,
if overall % identity is <98.5%, group into "no close match in HOMD"

if overall % identity is >= 98.5%,
If it matches a single HMT, add it to that HMT
If it matches multiple HMTs, divide the reads equally among the HMTs -- except for a few cases that I'd like to curate.  Let's figure this part out when we get there!

Talk to you soon,
Jessica

Next steps: frm email JMW(2021-12-14)
So, if we can correct those three things, step 1 is complete!

Step 2a will be to merge this table with the table showing counts for each oligotype in 
   each sample to create the counts matrix (observation matrix) with these taxonomy labels attached.

Step 2b will be to convert counts to percents so we have a matrix of percent abundance of 
   each oligotype in each sample.

Step 3 will be to group the oligotypes into species:
take the 99 oligotypes characteristic of gut, group them into "99 gut oligotypes";
For the remaining oligotypes,
if overall % identity is <98.5%, discard (or put into "no close match in HOMD")
then combine all remaining oligotypes that map to the same species,
and create a new table with % abundance of each species in each sample.
