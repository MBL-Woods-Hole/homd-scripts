RUNNING THE SCRIPTS (steps):
1) ./eren2014_blast_parse_abundance.py -i Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3.csv
   The infile has sequences that it writes into individual files then creates and runs
  a blast shell script (one blast command per *.fa file) then outputs the blast rusults
  in a specific format (all in the ./work directory)
2) Run the same script but with the --parse tag: 
   eren2014_blast_parse_abundance.py --parse
   This parses all the blast out files in ./work and calculates NUM_BEST_HITS BEST_PCT_ID BEST_FULL_PCT_ID
   Output is BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv
3) Hand-curation by JMW: must now add 'ABUNDANCE_IN' (Changed to BODY_SITE by JMW) column to BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv 
   (use V1-V3-BodySiteList-Curated-218-Firmicutes_fixed.csv as input)
   eren2014_combine_curtated.py -i1
4) Hand-curation by JMW: must now add 'Assign_reads_to' and 'Add_Note' columns to BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv
   (use BLAST_PARSE_RESULT-JMWcuration.csv as input)
   eren2014_combine_curtated.py

*** Percent is calculated by getting the sum of all oligotype counts in a particular sample 
    (e.g. 147406386-TD is a sample from the tongue dorsum of person 147406386), 
    then dividing the counts of each oligotype by the total counts in that sample.

*** Prevalence = 
   (# of individuals in which this HMT is non-zero at this site)/(total number of individuals for whom we have samples at this site)
   
qend-qstart+1 /qlength == fract align
FULL == PCTID*fract_align  should be == or less than PCTID

from email:
=======================================
There are a few oligotypes with anomalous results -- like V1V3_109_Actinobacteria has best-percent-ID 99.123% and full-percent-ID 100%.  What's going on there?  Full percent ID should always be less than or equal to best percent ID I think.
We can discuss -- I'm free all day.
Once that's figured out -- Great!  You have successfully assigned taxonomy to each oligotype!  Step 1 is complete.

Then we will need to do step 2: 
-add to this table the column showing "ABUNDANT_IN" in the attached "Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3".  We will use "ABUNDANT_IN" to figure out which samples are from stool.
***NOTE :: Use file V1-V3-BodySiteList-Curated-218-Firmicutes.csv instead***

Then: add the counts for each oligotype in each sample, from Dataset S01 here 
https://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/E2875/tab-figures-data
This will create a counts matrix (observation matrix) with these taxonomy labels attached.

Eliminate columns with fewer than (arbitrarily chosen) 800 total reads (I count 12 such columns)
***NOTE:: make it 1000 total reads per JMW

Then convert counts to percents so we have a matrix of percent abundance of each oligotype in each sample.  Save this, for future reference, as the percent matrix.

Then the last step:  group the oligotypes into species:
take the 99 oligotypes for which ABUNDANT_IN = ST and which are not Dialister invisus V1V3_218_Firmicutes (special pleading, ugh, but it's because Dialister invisus is a 100% match to an oral taxon.)
Group these 99 into "99 gut oligotypes".

For the remaining oligotypes,
if overall % identity is <98.5%, group into "no close match in HOMD"

if overall % identity is >= 98.5%,
If it matches a single HMT, add it to that HMT
If it matches multiple HMTs, divide the reads equally among the HMTs -- except for a few cases that I'd like to curate.  Let's figure this part out when we get there!

Talk to you soon,
Jessica

Next steps: frm email JMW(2021-12-14)
So, if we can correct those three things, step 1 is complete!

Step 2a will be to merge this table with the table showing counts for each oligotype in 
   each sample to create the counts matrix (observation matrix) with these taxonomy labels attached.

Step 2b will be to convert counts to percents so we have a matrix of percent abundance of 
   each oligotype in each sample.

Step 3 will be to group the oligotypes into species:
take the 99 oligotypes characteristic of gut, group them into "99 gut oligotypes";
For the remaining oligotypes,
if overall % identity is <98.5%, discard (or put into "no close match in HOMD")
then combine all remaining oligotypes that map to the same species,
and create a new table with % abundance of each species in each sample.

Input file:
   Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3.csv
From JMW:
           Our goal is to use column D (REP_SEQ) in a BLAST against HOMD 16S refSeq, 
           to recreate updated versions of columns J through P (best hit % identity, 
           best hit % coverage, number of HMTs that are equally best hits, 
           the names of these HMTs, 
           their HMT IDs, strain/clone numbers, and NCBI ID numbers.

Blast db is from HOMD refseq: 
    blastdb_refseq_V15.22.p9/HOMD_16S_rRNA_RefSeq_V15.22.p9.fasta*

script is:
   eren2014_abundance_parser.py

USAGE:
   Run it first time:
      eren2014_abundance_parser.py -i Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3.csv
   to create the *.fna and blast.sh and *.fna.out files
   Then run it again:
      eren2014_abundance_parser.py -parse
   To parse the *.fna.out files and create the final BLAST_PARSE_RESULT.csv

Meeting w/ Jessica

using Meren spreadsheet: Eren2014-FromDatasetS1-oligotypesV1V3.csv
write py script to take sequence from colD and blast it against all HOMD refseqdb blastdb
getting all top hist and find associated HMTs


1- make local blast db (write a pyscript to accomplish this) w/ HMTs in defline
NO USE HOMD_16S_rRNA_RefSeq_V15.22.p9.fasta* from:  /mnt/efs/lv1_dev/blastdb/blast_db/oral16S
  =>scp -i ~/.ssh/andy.pem ubuntu@node.homd.info:homd/HOMD_16S_rRNA_RefSeq_V15.22* ./
Sample defline:
   Bartonella schoenbuchensis | HMT-001 | Strain: A28SC | GB: GQ422708 | Status: Named | Preferred Habitat: Unassigned | Genome: Genome: yes

Write script: homd-scripts/abundance_eren2014_parse.py
One script to blast -- when done another script to parse the output
2-blast then parse output (we dont have a cluster)
