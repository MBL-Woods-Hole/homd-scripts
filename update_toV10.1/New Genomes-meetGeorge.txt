Move old blast scripts to 0.60 using soft links (HOW?)
(ask George) for new links to 3 trees
split and Test genome/refseq sequenceserver
Find 3 genomes 8619 => 8622 are they dropped?
find/test seqids with no annotation (only ncbi) find ftp doc (Ask George)
---------------------
In this FTP folder https://homd.org/ftp/genomes/NCBI/V10.1/ the 2 seqid_no_***.txt files list the SEQID without faa or ffn
The trees are currently here:

https://homd.org/ftp/phylogenetic_trees/genome/V10.1/
however when V10.1 is released, the “V10.1” should be changed to “current”
----------------------

For the drive space, are you talking about the blast server (192.168.1.60)?

The /mnt/svdb drive has 200GB, blastdb files already used 100Gb but still 100Gb left. Perhaps we should make symbolic link from /tmp to /mnt/xvdb/tmp?
/mnt/xvdb/blastdb

-----------
Correct.

But there are different ways to do it, for example, you can copy all codes to the hard drive of the new cloned VM.

But I feel that having codes on efs is safer, in case the VM crashed and is not recoverable or the virtual hard drive degraded  (albeit rare for AWS EC2).

Yes, unless you copy them, they are the same, because they are mounted to efs network drive.

You can copy entire homd-data folder to something like homd-data_V3.1 and then rename homd-data to homd-data_V3.0

On the server 0.40 make a soft link on the vm hard drive (not on efs) from homd-data_V3.0 to homd-data

And change nginx root folder to this  homd-data softlink

Similarly on the server 0.42 make a soft link on the vm hard drive (not on efs) from homd-data_V3.1 to homd-data

And change nginx root folder to this  homd-data softlink
----------------------
Now we have to think about a good strategy so we can work on another web server (a clone of current nginx) and once everything is done, it is a matter of switching to this new server (i.e., a different IP)


I think I can make a subdomain such as “dev.homd.org” and points to this new server.

You probably will have to copy all your current scripts (hopefully they are all centralized in a single folder) . For example if your scripts are all in a folder called “homd” somewhere in the path, then copy entire folder to something like “homd_V10.1”

Then on the current nginx server, rename homd to homd_V9.15 and create a softlink to homd_V9.15 as “homd” so the current web server will still see “homd” (pointing ot homd_V9.15 now).

On the new nginx server, do is similarly but create a softlink of homd_V10.1 as “homd” so when we go to “dev.homd.org” the server will use “homd” (= home_V10.1) as the basefold.

Later when the new server is ready, then we just make homd.org and www.homd.org
HOMD :: Human Oral Microbiome Database
Human Oral Microbiome Database
www.homd.org
to point to this new server IP.

 

How does this sound?

 ==============================================================

Hi George,

    These questions are about the blast server (sequenceserver) and how to get it available on the HOMD site.

Currently I have both instances running on 192.168.1.60 on two different ports:
genome blast server:  192.168.1.60:4567
refseq blast server:  192.168.1.60:4568
start/stop/status: using systemctl  (sudo systemctl status SS-genome or SS-refseq)

I'm using the old genome blast databases until we get it working.

On the website (node.js app):
    previously I've displayed the blast server using an iframe like this:

<iframe id='iframe_id' src="https://anviserver.homd.info/" title="HOMD BLAST Server"></iframe>

Previously I was using the subdomains "anviserver.homd.info" and "wiki.homd.info" that you registered earlier and I used nginx to
connect them to the correct localhost ports (they were on the webserver app 192.168.1.40). I had used certbot to create a valid
SSL certificates for the subdomains to make them public.

Now, I am unsure of the best way to show the blast server (without going to a subdomain and certbot)

Thoughts/questions:
homd.org/192.168.1.60:4567   -- any url that is after 'homd.org' like this will trigger a node.js route/request that I'm not sure how to handle.

The nginx that is running on the webserver(192.168.1.40) should handle the IPs from the blast server(*.1.60) but again - not sure how to handle that.

Do we need to use certbot and SSL certificates and subdomains (certbot cannot use raw IP addresses)?

I don't think that nginx needs to be running also on the blast server(*.1.60)

I've googled many pages related to nginx and how to handle this particular setup but not found an answer -- but I'm sure it has been done before so any suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks,
Andy




============================
--After looking over the fields available from both the ncbi and prokka genomes I came to the conclusion that ONLY data from the ncbi side should be represented on the genome information page (https://homd.org/genome/genome_description?gid=SEQF1595)
Is that okay?
   ans:Yes, things like Medium Number and Non-ATCC medium can be removed. Also I don’t think anyone ever use 16S rRNA from genomes. They can always go to NCBI to download if necessary. So I would say hide 18,19,20, and 22 for now.


--And what fields exactly should be shown on that page? Maybe everything in the header of the assembly_stats.txt file
   ans:I don’t think we need to put everything, and we should not reproduce info exactly. The most important thing is 3 HOMD Name and 4 Genome Sequence Name (from Organism name: in the assembly_stats.txt file) so that people know sometimes NCBI’s name is not correct.

--There are 3 ncbi genomes that have mangled data on the server: SEQF3713, SEQF3714, and SEQF2736
    ans:Those extra GCA folders must have been mistakenly copied in these 3 SEQFs, they can be removed.

--I think contigs are related to either ncbi or prokka - so any that I show on the genome info page should be just the ncbi.
Is that correct?
   ans:Yes, the contig IDs should be identical between NCBI and PROOKA, so that JBROWSE can show annotations from both.

 

--I couldn't find anything in the ncbi genome text files related to ATCC which I currently have on the genome info page. Can I abandon that?
   ans:If you mean item 18 and 19 (ATCC Medium) then yes they can be removed.

 
-- I'm matching the new genomes to the oral taxon id number using the organism name and that usually works, BUT:
     there are many organism names that just have 'sp.' in the species placeholder which won't resolve to a specific taxon.
    I think I'll need to do these by hand - but is there another way to resolve the taxonID from the genome?
   I'm Enclosing a text file of the no matches - some are easy to assign OraltaxonID to but others will take a little digging.
   ans:The file “new_gca_selected_8148_seqID.txt” has HMT-ID and Name for each SEQID, which is the correct name for the genome. You can get the name from HMT-ID from your database too. This name should be in 3   HOMD Name (Genus, Species) of our genome Meta info page. However this file doesn’t have the info for the existing SEQIDs (unless updated). I will make another file with all the 8622 SEQF IDs for the Version 10.1. It will be called SEQID_info.txt (this file will be in FTP download as well) I will let you know when it’s available. For the existing SEQF you can always look up the HMT-ID from your database for now, or Index of /ftp/genomes/NCBI/current/ (homd.org) the SEQID_info.txt file.

2022-12-15 Meet w/ George - no sound
THERE IS no spreadsheet so far, only directory
prokka -  NCBI
see email:
==================
V10.1 folder:
   /mnt/efs/bioinfo/projects/homd_add_genomes_V10.1
Prokka annotation folder:
   GCA_V10.1_all (by SEQF)
NCBI Annotation folder:
   prokka_V10.1_all(by SEQF) (or prokka_V10.1_all.1(by GCA))
=============================
8000+ new genomes
/mnt/efs/bioinfo/projects/homd_add_genomes_V10.1/
now 5 digits ! 

names with GCA format (genbankid) equivalent to SEQFXXXX
there is a table of conversions seqid_ver_gcaid.txt in homd_add_genomes_V10.1
/mnt/efs/bioinfo/projects/homd_add_genomes_V10.1/seqid_ver_gcaid.txt
there are 4 that have SEQF2832.2 or .3  -- a re-assembly
most are .1 --do we need another format in db or an new field?

db try 1.42
clone db to work on it
prepare a few dirs to copy and play with
