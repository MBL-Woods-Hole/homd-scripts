./homd_ncbi_blast_all_tophits-fd-24_old_and_new_names_short.xlsx

Attached is the names replacement file.  The current names are in columns D to J, the new names are in columns L to R.  
The names highlighted in blue are those changed.  Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions.  
I have the earlier working version of this file that has annotation of why decisions were made and about two dozen changes/fixes 
to make when the subsequent HOMD edition comes out after this initial release.
